ADVANCED CREATIVE CODING (SEMESTER 1)

WEEK 1

About My Process: Having never learned JavaScript before and only limited understanding of HTML-CSS, I was a little late to the game in the first week. After creating a few soundscapes that sounded eerily familiar to narrator in the 1984 audio book, I created this project. It contains 4-5 different iterations of the same basic combinations of sound with each, in order, getting more and more complex.


WEEK 2

About My Process: Having spent all of my first week and most of my second trying to get week 1 right, I was in an odd mental space. So, for Week 2, I decided to represent this chaos by making a noise piece of sound with ugly sounds adding together randomly in a visualisation of the grey noise within. I used sounds such as guns firing and cocking, bells ringing loudly, and drawers shutting to create a frustrating soundscape using the same techniques I could’ve put to making something sound great (possibly). So as much as I’d like to wish you enjoy, the idea is DON’T hehe.


WEEK 3

About My Process: Week 3 was one of, if not the absolute, favourite week I had. Having been raised by two architects, it was fun to return to the Flores Geometrici with the computer making studying its form so much more fun. For the week’s homework, after experimenting a little with the algorithm, I concluded no one form I make could justify the vast possibilities that two simple lines of code hold. So, I decided to make a geometry randomiser. Along the way I picked up how to make HTML sliders and checkboxes and have them pass over data to the JavaScript code.


WEEK 4

About My Process: For Week 4, I decided to do the writing assignment out of the two as I found the fractal patterns very intriguing. I wrote 1000 words and have attached the PDF in this repository. What I found most intriguing about the document is how it uses a filter to assign values on the grayscale over several iterations. It’s not a technique I had encountered before although it made sense instantly. The week also led me to a healthy dose of research on numbers in a complex space and wrapping my head around some of the beautiful visualisations that can come out of it!


WEEK 6

About My Process: For the introductory week to 3D, I decided to make a quick fork of the document used in the lecture and experiment with all that it can do once I tweak some values. Then I used it to create a simple continuously rotating form that changes its curvature, orientation, and rate of spinning based on the mouse position. One of the more interesting details of this code is using the Math.random() function strategically while assigning the line width to create a sense of a flicker leading to a visual, I found reminiscent of the Manchester United home kit from the Premier League season of 2020-21. I also experimented with linear gradients for the first time, and it was really satisfying.


WEEK 7

About My Process: Week 7 and the Introduction of threejs was my favourite. Having done industrial design and CAD for my undergraduate degree, I just instantly ‘got’ threejs and what it stood for although, happily, it took a lot longer to explore what all it could do (Leading me to use it in my final project). I decided to make a 3D scene representing my experience working in my room over the last couple weeks due to running a slight fever and how it had gotten increasingly mundane and one-dimensional. The scene is an absurdist viewpoint of what it felt like with – an endless loop of time as represented by the spinning top – alongside trying to get work done (making notes) while being constantly distracted by a laptop brimming with possibilities of entertainment (cat videos) while still stuck in a matrix-like prison.


WEEK 8

**** TRIGGER WARNING: Homework 1  and Homework 2 contain flashing lights. Please do not view if you are prone to photosensitive epilepsy. I have set it to not ‘play on open’. ***

Homework 1

About My Process: For the first homework of the week, I decided to use the final example provided on Moodle with sinewaves originating from the centre and explore some of the other operators used in GLSL. I was particularly interested in fract() and used it to calculate the petals and to create a pulsating effect by modifying the green value in the FragColor. I also used the floats of time and mouse X and Y position to change the colour of the result as the mouse moves and time passes. What I find the most fascinating about the result is the way the shapes melt into themselves in pulses as they change colour.

Homework 2

Link: https://mimicproject.com/code/a98f397a-acaa-add7-80fb-caa87c1ec6b8 

About My Process: For the second homework, I decided to take the same ideas applied in Homework 1 further to create three asynchronous flashing movements in what turned out to look like an acid dose representation of techno music I listened to in Goa. I’m not too big on techno so don’t hold me to it. The first uses the position of the mouse and the time it has passed since the program begun passed through a sin curve to create rotation that builds up speed in the upper two quadrants and slows down in the bottom while changing its direction of rotation based on whether the mouse is in the left two quadrants or the right two. The second uses the pulsating effects of the squares. The third is rooted in using functions such as sin, cos, tan, exp and fract while assigning colours to all the shapes on the canvas.
